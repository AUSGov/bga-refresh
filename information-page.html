            <p>Whether you're about to start a new business, buy an established business or turn your hobby into a business, youâ€™ll need to prepare yourself for any challenges you may face.</p>

            <p>Before you start to work in your new venture, we recommend you take some time to consider the following key areas to help develop your business.</p>


            <!-- Step 1 -->
            <h2 id="analyse-your-business-idea">1. Analyse your business idea</h2>

            <p>The very first step of the process is to do some research and analysis to determine whether your business idea has potential and if you&rsquo;re the best person to build it.</p>

            <p>Some questions to consider include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Is there a need for your product or service?</li>
                <li>Is there a desire for your product or service?</li>
                <li>Who will buy the product or service?</li>
                <li>How hard will it be to develop your idea?</li>
                <li>Is your idea financially viable?</li>
                <li>How will you protect your idea?</li>
                <li>Who are your competitors?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Consider yourself</h3>

            <p>Operating a business is not just about working for yourself. It also means having the necessary skills to grow and succeed.</p>

            <p>It&rsquo;s important to consider whether you really understand what&rsquo;s involved and whether you&rsquo;re suited to running a business. Ask yourself:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Why do you want to start a business?</li>
                <li>Do you have the skills to set-up and run your business or will you need to outsource?</li>
                <li>What are your <a>business and personal goals?</a></li>
                <li>What income do you need to generate for your business to be successful?</li>
                <li>Do you have the financial capacity and time to start and run your business?</li>
            </ul>

            
            <!-- Step 2 -->
            <h2 id="define-your-customers-and-competitors">2. Define your customers and competitors</h2>

            <p>Conduct <a href="">market research</a> to help you understand your customers, your competition and your market. Research your customer&rsquo;s habits, needs and where they&rsquo;re located. <a href="">Analyse who your competitors are, where they&rsquo;re located and what they do better than you.</a></p>

            <p>Through this research you&rsquo;ll understand:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>who your customers are, their needs and buying patterns</li>
                <li>who your competitors are, what they sell and for what price</li>
                <li>how you can improve your business, product or service to become more competitive</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When you conduct your research, you may want to consider:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>What your customer demands and expectations are?</li>
                <li>Where your customers are located?</li>
                <li>How and where they receive marketing?</li>
                <li>Who your competitors are?</li>
                <li>What are they selling and for what price?</li>
                <li>How they market their business?</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Step 3 -->
            <h2 id="develop-your-business-plan">3. Develop your business plan</h2>
            <p>An essential part of starting your business is developing your business plan. This will include the operational, financial and marketing aspects of your business.
            </p>
            <p>A business plan is important if you are looking for a loan, applying for a business grant or pitching to investors. Lenders and investors want to see the true potential of your business idea. The plan can also help you identify your goals&nbsp;and develop strategies for achieving them.
            </p>
            <p>Use our <a href="">business planning templates</a> to help prepare your plan.&nbsp;to help prepare your plan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember a business plan is a living document. You should review it regularly to remind yourself of your goals and modify it when plans change.
            </p>
            
            <!-- Step 4 -->
            <h2 id="recognise-risk">4. Recognise risk</h2>
            <p>
                While setting up your business can be an exciting time you should also think about how you can protect your future business in times of crisis or change. Create an
                <a href="">
                    emergency management
                </a>
                &nbsp;and succession plan, to prepare and protect yourself against potential risks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider what you would do:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    during a natural disaster
                </li>
                <li>
                    if you could no longer run your business
                </li>
                <li>
                    if you retire
                </li>
                <li>
                    during technological disruption
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            
            <!-- Step 5 -->
            <h2 id="determine-your-business-structure">5. Determine your business structure</h2>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Pick a business structure that best suits your needs. Your business structure refers to the way you will operate your business. You can also <a href="">
